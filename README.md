[![Publish Preview Packages](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Translations/actions/workflows/stage.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OrchardCMS/OrchardCore.Translations/actions/workflows/stage.yml)

Orchard Core translations provide two kinds of NuGet packages:

- __Culture Specific Packages__: A NuGet package that targets a single culture, named `OrchardCore.Translation.{culture}.nupkg` where `{culture}` is the culture it contains.
- __Translations Meta Package__: A NuGet package named `OrchardCore.Translation.All.nupkg` which references all translation packages that Orchard Core supports out of the box.
